# Scripts Folder
This folder contains the R scripts used for processing, analysing and classifying raster data. Below is a breakdown of the contents of this folder. 

1. **Preprocessing:**
This folder contains scripts for preprocessing raw data and preparing them for further analysis.

2. **Site-Classification:**
This folder contains scripts for classifying the prepared rasters using a random forest learner. The learner will output a classified raster, which can be saved and used in further analyses. 

3. **Classification-Accuracy:**
This folder contains scripts for verifying the accuracy of the random forest learner by comparing the previously classified raster with a new set of known points. 

4. **Error-Analysis:**
This folder contains scripts for performing a random-effects ANOVA test to determine the extent to which within- and between-site variation influences classification accuracy.
